# Blockchain Smart Contract Development Learning Repository

Welcome to my journey through blockchain smart contract development! This repository is a living document of my learning process, featuring projects that explore various aspects of blockchain technology using the Solidity programming language and the Brownie Python framework for deployment on the Ethereum network.

## Projects Overview

- **ERC20 Token**: Implementation of a standard ERC20 token that can be used for a wide range of applications on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **MIX**: A mixed contract project that demonstrates the use of multiple smart contract concepts and integrations.
- **FunMe**: A simple transactional contract for initiating and managing transactions, illustrating the basics of smart contract interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
